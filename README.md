This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison using the == operator. The bug is in the foo function, which uses loose comparison to check if either a or b is equal to 1.  The solution shows how to use strict equality (===) to avoid this problem.  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected type coercion and incorrect results.  Always use strict equality unless you have a specific reason not to.
